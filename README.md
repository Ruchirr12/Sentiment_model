Streamlit Render Sentiment Prediction App
This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that allows users to input text and get sentiment predictions for the entered text. The app utilizes a machine learning model trained to classify sentiment as either positive or negative.

Features
Input text: Users can enter text into a text input box.
Sentiment prediction: The application takes the entered text and predicts the sentiment associated with it, classifying it as either positive or negative.
Real-time results: The predicted sentiment is displayed to the user immediately after they submit the text.
User-friendly interface: The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with.
Setup
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the Streamlit Render Sentiment Prediction App on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended):

shell
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:

shell
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

shell
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.

Run the Streamlit app:

shell
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The application will start running, and the command prompt will display a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501). Open this URL in your web browser.

Enter text into the provided input box and click the "Predict" button to see the sentiment prediction for the entered text.

Experiment with different texts to observe the sentiment predictions in real-time.

Customization
If you wish to customize or extend the application, you can modify the app.py file. The machine learning model used for sentiment prediction can be replaced with your
own model if desired. You can also enhance the user interface by modifying the Streamlit components in the app.py file.
